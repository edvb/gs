The only dependency needed to build gs is cURL. gs be compiled with a simple 'make' and 'sudo make install' will install the executable and man page.
.PP
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
.PP
gs can be customized by editing the custom 'config.h' and (re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple. All customization can be done through the command line interface however, so basic aliases could also be utilized to change default options.
